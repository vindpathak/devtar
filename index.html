        Major Dev Rawat carries an ancient demonic element in his veins. The old war between Asuras and Devas spills into the human world — and Dev must fight on three fronts: for his country, for humanity, and for the universe itself.

      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        The war that began between Asuras and Devas has now reached within humans. Major Dev Rawat's battles are not just external: the demonic element inside him pulls at his choices, his loyalties, his sense of self. As a fearsome Asura returns and an external enemy threatens to bring his country to its knees, Dev becomes the only hope — a guardian whose victory may cost him everything.
